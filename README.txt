MTools imported as an Eclipse project.

Can be ran via opening the plugin.xml of a given projecting and clicking run or debug in the upper right corner.

Or alternatively just to copy the files from /MtoolsUpdateSiteProject/plugins (the 3 jar plugin files) into $ECLIPSE_HOME/dropins.

Can also use the project 'MToolsUpdateSite' to create and deploy p2 update site later (as is done in RASR).


Notes:
Refer to /MiscDependencies and /docs for complete installation details.
